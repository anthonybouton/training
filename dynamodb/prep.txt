Have Docker Installed ( Linux based )
Have DynamoDB Workbench installed ( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/workbench.settingup.html )
Have the AWS CLI Installed ( https://aws.amazon.com/cli/ )
Have .NET 5.0 SDK Installed ( https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0 )



1. Start your local instance of DynamoDB
Open a terminal and run "docker-compose up -d dynamodb" (without the quotes)

2. Open DynamoDB Workbench and verify your connection to your local DynamoDB
Open the operation builder in the workbench and press "Add Connection"
Hit the tab that says "DynamoDB Local" and give the connection a name that makes sense to you
After adding the connection press Open on the newly added connection
You are now connected to your local DynamoDB Instance!

3. Configure the AWS CLI
Since we are using the local DynamoDB, every access key id and secret access key will work, that is, if we configured the cli
In the terminal type
aws configure
